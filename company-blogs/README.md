# Company Blogs - Retail Partner Landing Pages

This directory contains professional landing pages for three fictional retail companies that serve as alternatives when QuickMart is not hiring. These websites are designed to appear legitimate and convincing when users search for these companies online.

**🖼️ All websites now feature the provided Kenyan retail/commercial images** integrated into hero sections, product showcases, store galleries, and feature demonstrations.

## 🎯 Purpose

When users apply for certain positions at QuickMart and reach the 105-second mark in the application process, they see a "QuickMart not hiring" screen. This leads them to choose from three alternative companies, and these landing pages provide the legitimacy and credibility needed to convince users that these companies actually exist and operate across Kenya.
